As an engineer, I am always excited to learn about new technologies and Nate gave us the complete freedom to do so. Under Nate, our team was able to implement Ansible and Jenkins, along many other tools to implement Automated Patching and Automated Backups to 500 servers. This was a first for our division, and a big win in terms of automation. Nate was an awesome leader, and really made working so much fun, as well as highly encouraging further learning.",
