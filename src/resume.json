Nate gave us complete freedom to try new things, implement new technologies, and show off Proof of Concepts wherever we saw fit. As an engineer, I am always excited to learn about new technologies and Nate gave us the complete freedom to do so. Under Nate, our team was able to implement Ansible and Jenkins, along many other tools to implement Automated Patching and Automated Backups to 500 servers. This was a first for our division, and a big win in terms of automation. Nate was an awesome leader, and really made working so much fun, as well as highly encouraging further learning.",

As a skilled engineer who understands the importance of technical practices such as Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Delivery; Nate understands how to build quality in. Couple that with his now extensive experience as an Agile Practitioner, and Nate has developed a coaching skillset to compliment his technical expertise.
